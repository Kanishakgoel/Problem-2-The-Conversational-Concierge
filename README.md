🔧 Technical Details
Architecture
The agent uses a router-based system to determine the best response method:

Knowledge Base: Pre-defined wine business information

Weather API: Real-time Napa Valley weather data

Web Search: External information retrieval with multiple fallbacks

Simple Responses: Keyword-based direct answers

Search Fallback System
DuckDuckGo Search API (primary)

Google web scraping (fallback)

Knowledge graph responses (final fallback)

Weather Service
Uses Open-Meteo free weather API

Provides temperature and conditions

Includes wine-specific weather recommendations

🛠️ Customization
Modify Wine Knowledge
Edit wine_knowledge.md or update the WINE_KNOWLEDGE dictionary in wine_agent.py:

python
WINE_KNOWLEDGE = {
    "about": "Your custom about text",
    "wines": {
        "your_wine": "Description and price"
    },
    # Add more categories as needed
}
Add New Response Types
Extend the enhanced_response() function in wine_agent.py:

python
def enhanced_response(user_input: str) -> str:
    # Add your custom responses
    custom_responses = {
        'your_keyword': 'Your custom response',
    }
    # ... existing code
